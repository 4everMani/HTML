1) <b> tag will make text bold only, browser make text inside <strong> bold and it shows importance and ergency.
so using strong tag make more sense.  

2) <sub> tag is used to create a subscript like H2O.

3) Always remeber we do not create styling using HTML, We arrange content of page using HTML, so it becomes important to use right tag for right purpose. 
For example effect of <del> tag can be easily achieved using css, but it makes HTML code more readable. 

4) A "citation" is the way you tell your readers that certain material in your work came from another source. It also gives your readers the information necessary to find that source again, including:

* information about the author
* the title of the work
* the name and location of the company that published your copy of the source
* the date your copy was published
* the page numbers of the material you are borrowing

5) The <iframe> HTML element represents a nested browsing context, embedding another HTML page into the current one.
